### Incorrect Comparison Logic

The initial implementation had incorrect conditions for comparing nodes. The correct conditions for inserting intervals into the tree are:

- `node.end <= self.start`: The new node should be inserted into the left subtree if its end time is less than or equal to the current node's start time.
- `node.start >= self.end`: The new node should be inserted into the right subtree if its start time is greater than or equal to the current node's end time.

The original comparison logic (`node.end >= self.start` and `node.start <= self.end`) was incorrect and caused nodes to be inserted incorrectly.

### Wrong Subtree Insertion

In the `elif` part of the original code, the new node was being inserted into the left subtree, which was incorrect. It should be inserted into the right subtree.

Additionally, if no condition matches, the method should return `False` by default, indicating that the interval overlaps with an existing one.
